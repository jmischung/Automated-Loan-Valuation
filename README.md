# Automated Loan Valuation

The purpose of this project is to serve as an introduction to loan analyzers with lenders showing the automation opportunity with Python. It is deliberately simple to illustrate how much can be automated with a few short and reusable lines of code, encouraging the exploration of what other more complex and time consuming processes can be automated with Python.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7.

## Installation Guide

Ensure the environment in which the program is being run is python 3.7 or greater.

## Usage

To use the automated loan valuer clone the repository. In the current rudimentary state of the program the loan information is hardcoded into the **loan_analyzer.py** file beginning at line 154.

Once the loans have been hardcoded, run the program by entering the following command in the terminal:  

`python loan_analyzer.py`  

Below is an example output:
